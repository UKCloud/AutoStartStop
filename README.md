# Automatically Start & Stop VMs
These scripts are examples of how you can make use of VMWare PowerCLI to set up a timed schedule for automatically starting and stopping vApps or VMs in vCloud Director.

These examples are fully documented in [Blueprint uck-gen-339](https://ukcloud.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/ukcloud_blueprint_ukc-gen-339_manipulating-power-states-with-powercli.pdf) on the UKCloud web site.

These example scripts have been written to leverage the use of metadata properties that can be set against either a vApp, or each individual VM. There are two sets of scripts provided to demonstrate this functionality.

### Report Current Metadata settings
The CheckVAPPMetadata.ps1 and CheckVMMetadata.ps1 scripts will generate a report of your vApps / VMs respectively, writing out a CSV file containing the currently set Metadata properties. You can use these two scripts to show which VMs are configured to be automatically started and stopped.

### Starting and Stopping VMs
The AutoPowerVAPP.ps1 and AutoPowerVM.ps1 scripts will use the metadata properties reported on in the above Check scripts to automatically start and stop vApps / VMs respectively. To gain the most benefit from these scripts, you will want to run them regularly throughout the day, probably by setting up a windows scheduled task to run them hourly or more regularly.
